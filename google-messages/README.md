# Handover Google Messages client

An independent Google Messages protocol client for Handover, developed without
mautrix-gmessages. The target is Google Messages companion access, including RCS;
it still requires Google Messages on the phone and Google's service.

This directory currently contains an anonymous bootstrap evidence collector.
It does not yet authenticate, pair, read conversations, or send messages. The
existing adapter remains in use while this implementation is developed.

This code is part of Handover and covered by the root MIT license.

## Collect first-party evidence

```sh
python3 google-messages/tools/capture_bootstrap.py --output /tmp/handover-google-bootstrap
python3 -m unittest discover -s google-messages/tests
```

The output directory must not already exist. Captures contain public Google
HTML/JavaScript and a manifest of source URLs, hashes, sizes, and candidate RPC
method names. The collector does not execute JavaScript, use cookies, or import
an existing account session. Raw captures are research inputs, not repository
sources, and must stay outside Git.

## Integration target

Implement the existing Handover helper IPC v1, documented in
[`docs/gmessages-sidecar.md`](../docs/gmessages-sidecar.md). Handoverd remains authoritative for normalized
runtime state; credentials and Google protocol details remain inside this client.
Do not copy or import the AGPL adapter, its upstream code, or generated protocol
definitions. Derive protocol behavior from first-party observations and verified
specifications, using established cryptographic libraries.

The first acceptance checkpoint is fresh pairing and a read-only conversation
and history fetch without loading mautrix. Later checkpoints cover incoming
updates, text and media sends, delivery evidence, logout, and recovery. No send
capability is advertised before it is implemented and verified.
